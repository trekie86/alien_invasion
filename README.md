# Alien Invasion
Alien Invasion project from Python Crash Course (2nd Edition)

My first attempt at making any type of game using Python and utilizing the pygame library.

## Running this yourself

It is always recommended to create a new virtual environment when writing python code, to setup your environment within this folder run the following commands.

```sh
# Setup the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
# Upgrade pip
pip --upgrade pip
# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Run the program (note because we setup the virtual environment with python3, commands such as python & pip actuall are referenced to python3 & pip3 respectively)
python alien_invasion.py
```
